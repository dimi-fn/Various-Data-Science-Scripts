# Hands on Machine Learning

Various coding scripts and notes based on the book [*Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by *Aurelien Geron*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Part of those was used as study material for my attendance at the CS985 course (Machine Learning) at Strathclyde University (2019-20).
