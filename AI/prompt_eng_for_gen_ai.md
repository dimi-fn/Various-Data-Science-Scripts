# Intro

Prompt engineering for generative AI is the design of instructions or input text (prompts) in order to guide the AI model's output and generate desired responses. It can also influence the behaviour and the performance of the generative AI model, allowing greater control and customization in the outputs.

# Learning Techniques

The are various techniques you can create prompts for Gen AI. The below are chatGPT answers:

1. `Zero-Shot Learning`

**Description**: The model is prompted to perform a task without any specific training data for that task. It generalizes from related knowledge learned during training.

**Example**: Prompt the model with "Translate the following English sentence to French: 'Hello, how are you?'" The model generates the French translation.

---------

2. `Few-Shot Learning`

**Description**: The model is trained with a limited amount of data for a new task and learns to perform the task with only a few examples.

**Example**: Fine-tune a language model with a few examples of positive and negative sentiment sentences and prompt it to generate sentiment scores for new sentences.

---------

3. `Prompt Tuning`

**Description**: The prompt is iteratively refined and optimized to improve model performance, using techniques like human feedback or reinforcement learning.

**Example**: A chatbot prompt is tuned by experimenting with various phrasings to encourage more polite responses.

---------

4. `Prefix-Tuning`

**Description**: A specific prefix is added to the input text to guide the model's behavior and provide context for generating desired outputs.

**Example**: Add the prefix "Translate the following text to Spanish: " to instruct the model to generate the Spanish translation of the provided text.

---------

5. `Contrastive Learning`

**Description**: Prompts are designed to create contrastive examples that highlight the differences between correct and incorrect outputs.

**Example**: Use prompts that present a correct statement and a similar incorrect version, asking the model to identify the accurate one.

---------

6. `Rule-Based Prompts`

**Description**: Prompts use predefined rules and templates to enforce specific structures or constraints on the generated outputs.

**Example**: Create a template prompt like "Generate a [color] [animal]," instructing the model to fill in the blanks to produce specific combinations like "Generate a blue elephant."

---------

7. `Data Augmentation`

**Description**: The training data is augmented with variations of prompts to make the model more robust and improve generalization.

**Example**: Generate different phrasings of a prompt or rephrase the same prompt to provide more diverse training data.

---------

8. `Adapters`
**Description**: Small neural network components are added to the model to handle specific tasks or domains without modifying the entire model.

**Example**: Incorporate a translation adapter into a pre-trained language model to enable translation tasks.

---------

9. `Conditional Prompting`
**Description**: The model is conditioned on specific attributes or variables in the prompt to generate outputs meeting particular criteria or requirements.

**Example**: Prompt the model with "Generate a happy poem about nature," guiding it to produce a positive and nature-themed poem.
