| `SQL`| `noSQL`|
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Relational database |  Non-relational database|
| tables (columns and rows, each row is identified by a unique key)| key-value stores, documents (JSON, XML, etc), graphs, flexible tables|


* `SQL`: it stands for Structured Query Language and it is a language used for interacting with Relational Database Systems (RDBMSs)
* One of the main differences between SQL and NoSQL is that the former is a relational database architecture and it is in the form of tables, while the latter is in the form of key-value pairs with collections of documents (tables in SQL are collections in NoSQL)
* `CRUD` operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete
