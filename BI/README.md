# Microsoft Power BI

----- 

## Elements/Parts of Power BI

1) Power BI `Desktop`: Microsoft Windows desktop application, [download-install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-get-the-desktop#download-power-bi-desktop-directly)
2) Power BI `service`: online SaaS (Software as a Service)
3) `Mobile apps`: available on phones and tablets

## Concepts

Building blocks of PowerBI:
* `datasets`
* `reports`
* `dashboards`

Those are organized into **workspaces** and they are created on **capacities**

### Capacities

`Capacities`: set of resources used to host and deliver the PowerBI content. They are either *shared* or *dedicated*
* **Dedicated**: capacity is fully committed to a single customer. It requires a <u>subscription</u>
* **Shared**: shared with other customers. By <u>default</u>, workspaces are created under this a shared capacity.

### Workspaces

Staging areas and containers for datasets, reports, dashboards, and dataflows.

There are two types:
1) `My workspace`: personal workspace for any PowerBI customer to collaborate with your content. Only you have access to "my workspace".
2) `Workspaces`: they are used to collaborate and share content with colleagues. Requirement: workspace members need PowerBI Pro licenses.

### Apps

* Collection of dashboards and reports to deliver *key metrics* to PowerBI consumers

* Although apps are interactive, consumers (and colleagues who have access to those) cannot edit them. However they do not need Pro licenses to access the apps.
