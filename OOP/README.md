## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### OOP.ipynb
* `Classes & Objects`
* `def __init__(self, )`
* `Encapsulation`
* `Inheritance`
* `Polymorphism`

### Other files

* car.py and get_car_details.py: they show that the example "2.3" in OOP.ipynb can be done with two files:
the class "Car" is created in the file called `car.py`, hence now `car` is a module that can be imported in another file
(`get_car_details.py`) with "`from car import Car`" command since we have car.py file (`from car`) and the name of the class was "Car" (`import Car`).
