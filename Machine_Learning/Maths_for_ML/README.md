# Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning

Practicing  some code demonstrated during the ["Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra" course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/home/welcome), with reference to:

* Creating a code fragment that traps for different types of special matrices, and classifying the type of the special case encountered.

* Constructing a function that follows the Gram-Schmidt procedure, which takes a list of vectors and forms an orthonormal basis from this set (an orthonomal basis vector set is composed of unit length vectors which at the same time are orthogonal to each other).
