# MATLAB

* Use the Up arrow to see previous commands


* If you add a semicolon to the end of a command, the result will not be displayed, however, the result of that command will be displayed in the Workspace window as usual.

* MATLAB does not rerun previous commands in the Command Window (you need to repeat the command for any variable changes)
