------

# Commands - Basic Syntax

[Semicolon (;) indicates end of statement. However, if you want to suppress and hide the MATLAB output for an expression, add a semicolon after the expression](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/matlab_syntax.htm).

* Use the Up arrow to see previous commands
    * `clear` to empty workspace / `clc` to empty the Command Window
    * `clear classes`

* Use [disp](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/disp.html)(X) to print messages while debugging functions as well as the given strings to command window
    * e.g.: `disp('starting the loop')`
    * A = [10 100]; => then disp(A) will print out 10 100 without showing the "A" variable

* Comments
* % This is a comment on Matlab code cell    
    * Matlab **markdown** https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/marking-up-matlab-comments-for-publishing.html



            %{
            This is
            a multiline comment
            %}

    
* `which pathdef`: search path

* MATLAB variables are case sensitive. They should start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores

* MATLAB does not rerun previous commands in the Command Window (you need to repeat the command for any variable changes)

* Use `format long` to display all decimal places

**Note: *Single quotes create a character vector and double quotes create a string. In most cases, strings are preferable.*
* x = ['1','2'] will give a character array '12'
* y = ["1","2"] will give a 1x2 string array with entries "1" and "2"

**Built-in constants**:
* pi (for Ï€)

* `i` is an imaginary number, a built-in constant in MATLAB

**Built-in functions**:
* `abs()`, `sqrt()` `eig()` (eigenvalues), `sin()` (sine)

* Use parentheses to pass inputs to functions, e.g.: y = sin(x)

## Import - Load Data

* [How to Import Data from Text Files Interactively in MATLAB ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akV43a5hNfM&ab_channel=MATLAB)

* You can import .mat, .jpg, .txt, and .csv files by the "import data" tool
    * csv files can be stored in various ways. Missing data will be displayed with orange colour

* you can select column tables (**features**) via `tableName.columnName`

* you can interact with the table via the output table pane on the right
    * e.g. you can sort values, and then use the "update code" functionality

* you can **extract rows** by array indexing
    * e.g. to extract the first 4 rows and assign that to a variable: `x= tableName(1:4, :)` -->x will also be a table

* `load <filename.mat>` to load again the variables of the file, then type <filename> to print the matrix
    * load only one variable from a .mat file containing multiple variables: `load filename x`
    * use command `usage` under `load <filename.mat>` to see the matrix after loading the file
    * use `data.VariableName` to extract a specific variable (feature / table value / column value) from a [table](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/access-data-in-a-table.html)

*Note*: No need to initialize variables in MATLAB

* **saving**: 
    * `save filename.mat`
    * `.m` files are like .py files in Python, whereas .mlx files (live scripts that contain the code, the output, and the formatted text together in the Live Editor) are like .ipynb files

* use **importdata** to import data from files on hard drive
    * `x = importdata('textFile.txt);`
        * x will be of type struct 

-------

# Desktop & Editor

1) Current folder
2) Command Window 
3) Workspace

## Scripts & Live Scripts

* To organize all commands and their output: "New **live script**" in the toolstrip
    * add "Code" or "Text" for description
    * saving the live script will save the code, output, and descriptions
    * you can click "workspace" to view variables in workspace gets minimized after commands execution

<br>

* **Scripts**: `.m files` containing commands executed in sequence

-------

# Vectors & Matrices

**All MATLAB variables are arrays**. 
* scalars (i.e., single number containing 1 row and 1 column)
* vectors (1D)
* matrices (2D)
    * row vectors and column vectors

* Arrays can be used to store related data in one variable.

* Examples
    * scalar: `x = 4` --> `arr = np.array(4)` in Python
    * row vector 1x2: `x = [5 , 9]` or `x = [5 9]` --> `arr = np.array([5, 9])` in Python
    * column vector 2x1 `x = [5;9]` --> `arr = np.array([[5], [9]])` in Python 


    * matrix of 2x3: `x= [1,3,5;2,4,6]` --> 1st row==[1,3,5], 2nd row==[2,4,6]

| Example          | Description    | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| 3      | scalar |     
| [3  5]  or [3,5]  | row vector |     
| [3;5]      | column vector |     
| [3 5 9 ; 0 2 4 ]     | matrix |     



## Evenly-Spaced Vectors

* **evenly-row spaced vector**: `x = [1:4]` or `x= 1:4` or `x=[1,2,3,4]` | `:` is **inclusive** [inclusive, inclusive]

* [**start** : `step` : **end**]: e.g. 1 to 10 with step 2 would be: `x =[1 : 2 : 10]` 
    * *whereas in Python step would be at the end*

* if you know the number of elements you want in a vector beforehand -> use `linspace(first,la1,1st,number_of_elements).`
    * `x = linspace(0,10,5)` will give 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 which gives a row vector 1x5
    * use `transpose` to turn it into a column vector of 5x1: `x_transpose = x'` 

* create a column vector using a single command by creating a row vector and then transpose it all on one line.
    * `x = (4:2:10)'` will give a column vector 4x1, with the elements: 4,6,8,10

| Example          | Description    | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| 2:5      | Create a vector from 2 to 5, spaced by 1, using the [colon (:)](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colon.html) operator |     
| 4:2:10      | Create a vector from 4 to 10, with a step of 2 | 
| [linspace](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/linspace.html)1,20,5      | Create a vector with 5 elements, the values of which are evenly spaced from 1 to 20 | 

<br>

**Create Matrices**
| Example          | Description    | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| [rand](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/rand.html)(2)    | Create a square matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns |     
| [zeros](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/zeros.html)(2,3)    | Create a rectangular matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns. |   

<br>

** Note: 
 If `linspace` or `:` is used to create a vector, then brackets ("[]") are not needed

## Array Creation Functions

* e.g., `x = rand(4)` will create a 4x4 matrix with random numbers
* Specify number of rows/columns, e.g., `x = rand(3,2)` will create a 3x2 matrix with random numbers
    * you can fill matrices containing only zeros or one using the `zeros()` and `ones()` functions respectively. E.g. `x = zeros(4,2)` will give a 4x2 matrix filled out with 0s


* Get the **size of an array**: `size(x)`
    * `[Xrow, Xcol] = size(X)` create two variables comprising the size of X
    * `help size` for more

<br>

**Array Operations**
| Example          | Description    | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  [1 1 ; 1 1]*[2 2 ; 2 2] => will give 4, 4, 4, 4 | [Matrix Multiplication](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/array-vs-matrix-operations.html#btyv9yp-4)  |     
| [1 1 ; 1 1].*[2 2 ; 2 2] => will give 2, 2, 2, 2  | [Element-wise Multiplication](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/array-vs-matrix-operations.html#bu90xxy-1)   |

<br>

# Indexing into and Modifying Arrays

*Vectors: x(idx), Matrices: x(row, col)*

The **1st index position** starts at `1` (not 0 as in Python)

* e.g. `x(3) = 5`, will index the 3rd position element and change its value to 5

* extract a **range** of values, e.g. x=(2:4) (inclusive, inclusive)

* if you want to extract a **specifix element from a matrix**, e.g. the 3rd element in the first row, then: x=(1,3) (== 1st row, 3rd column)

* extract **all first row**: `x= (1:)`

* extract **all first column**: `x(:,1)`

* `end`: You can use the MATLAB keyword end as either a row or column index to reference the last element
    * e.g. if data the filename, then: `x = data(end, 2)` will return the the element which is located in the last row and in the 2nd column
    * `x = data(end-1, 3)` will give the scalar located in the second to last row in the 3rd column

| Example          | Description    | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| M([end](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/end.html), 2)     | Access the element in the second column of the last row |     
| M(3,:)    | Access the entire 3rd row |     
| M(1:4,:) | Access all columns of the first four rows. |     
| A(2) = 10| Change the value of the second element of the array to 10 |     

<br>

## Extracting Multiple Elements

* grab all elements located in the 4th column: `x= data(:, 4)`

* grab all elements containing the last 3 columns: x = data(:, end-2:end)

## Changing Values in Arrays

* e.g. add a scalar value of 1 to all elements of an array (vector): `x2= x1 + 1;`

* add vectors of the same size, e.g. `v3 = v1+v2;`

* multiplication
    * `*` : matrix multiplication
    * `.*`: elementwise multiplication, e.g. x = [3,4] * [5,6] will give Error using  * Incorrect dimensions for matrix multiplication." ==> x = [3,4] .* [5,6]

## Logical Indexing


* equal: `==` | not equal: `~=`
* True / False in MATLAB is expressed in 1 and 0 respectively
* and: `&`, or: `|`
    * e.g. x = v1(v1<8 & v1>4) will find values less than 8 and greater than 4

* you can compare a vector or matrix to a single scalar value using relational operators
    * e.g. [3 6 9] > 8 =>output=> 0 0 1

* choose a **subset** of array via a logical array
    * e.g. : v2 = v1(v1>6) will assign to v2 all values for which v1>6 is true
    * x(x==10) = 20  => replace all values in x that are equal to 10 with the value 20

* replace values: e.g.: x(x==10) = 2, will replace all x values that are currently 10 into 2

------

# Functions
* `function[x,y,z] = funName(input1, input2)` 

* matrix_size = size(data)

* Create the variables x and y which respectively contain the number of rows and columns of the variable z: [x,y]= size(z)

* max function: `[maxVal, maxIdx] = max(x)` (same for min())
    * where maxVal == the max value of x, Idx == the index value that the max value will be assigned with
        * if you only max(a) and a is a 2D array of shape (x,y), then you will get the max value for every y column value, i.e. the shape result will be (1 , y)

* use a tilde (`~`) to ignore specific outputs

* `fft(y)`: compute the discrete Fourier transform of a vector
    * since that gives complex numbers as an output, you might want to: result = abs(fft(y)), to get the absolute value-magnitude

* Use `disp` to print messages while debugging functions as well as the given strings to command window
    * e.g.: `disp('starting the loop')`

## Anonymous Functions

`x = function( @(<input>) (<function to evaluate>), );`

## Methods

* Write functions in their own **files**
    * e.g. myFunction should be in a file by itself, and the file should be called myFunction.m
    * if there is more than one function per file, then only the 1st function will be accessible in other scripts
    * [Mathworks: Create Functions in Files](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-functions-in-files.html)

------

# Visualization - Plotting

* [MATLAB plot gallery documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/plot-gallery.html)

* Two vectors of the same length can be plotted against each other using the plot function: `plot(x,y)`
    * use log scales for each axis: `loglog(x,y)`

* `plot(x, y, "LineSpec")`, [Line Specification documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/linespec.html) 
    * e.g., plot(x,y,"r--o") will have a red (r) dashed (--) line with a circle (o) as a marker
    
* Use line width of specific value, e.g. `plot(x, "LineWidth", 4)` will print a line width of 4. [Line Properties](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.graphics.chart.primitive.line-properties.html)


* use *line specification* along with *line properties*, e.g.: `plot(x,y, "ro-","LineWidth", 3)`
    * e.g. `plot(v1, v2, "ro-", "LineWidth", 4)` will plot the 2 vectors with red(r) cicle(o) markers, and the line width will be of 4

* to plot one line on top of the other type `hold on`
    *e.g.: 

        plot(x,y,"r--o")
        hold on
        plot(x,z, "r*")     %(red star marker)
        hold on
        plot(x, w, "ks")    %k for black, s for square marker)


* When you plot a single vector by itself, MATLAB uses the vector values as the y-axis data and sets the x-axis data to range from 1 to n, where n is the number of elements in the vector

* descriptions
    * add title to graph: `title`("here is the plot's title")
    * x-axis description: `xlabel("here is the x-label title")`
    * y-axis description: `ylabel("here is the y-label title")`

* add **legends**: `legend(" ", " ")`

* focus on a specific area of interest in terms of range of values: `xlim([xmin , xmax])` or: xlim([xmin xmax])
    * after plot(x,y) you can use xlim for plotting specific areas of the graph

* In the right section of outputs, you can use the *output pane* to interact with specific values across the chart


* use `pause()` function to animate the plots in conjunction with using `hold on` and `hold off`, example: 
   
        for idx= 1:5 
            hold on
            plot(idx, density(idx),"*")
            hold off
            pause(0.9)
        end

* save figures in:
    * `.fig` preserves al information
    * `.bmp` uncompressed image
    * `.eps` high-quality scaleable format
    * `.pdf` compressed image


* `help imread` for image supports

<br>

| Example          | Description    | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| [plot](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot.html)(x,y, "ro-", "LineWidth", 6)    | Plot a red (r) dashed (--) line with a circle (o) marker, with a line width of 6 |     
|  [hold](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/hold.html) on |  Add the next line to existing plot |
| hold off |  Create a new axes for the next plotted line |
|title("TitleName") | Add title description |
| xlabel("x-label title")| title of x-axis |
| ylabel("y-label title")| title of y-axis |

<br>

## 3D - Surfaces - Matrices

* 3D plot: e.g. `plot(x,y,z, 'k', 'LineWidth', 3);`

Any matrix can be visualized as an image
* **imagesc** automatically scales the values to span the entire colormap


        imagesc(matrix)
        colorbar`  % put colourbal


* let X,Y,Z be matrices
    * use `meshgrid`
        * **surf** puts vertices at specified points in space x,y,z and connects all the vertices to make a surface, use meshgrid for that

                x = -pi : 0.1 : pi;
                y = -pi : 0.1 : pi;
                [X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y);

                Z = sin(X) .*cos(Y);

                % plot
                surf(X,Y,Z);

# Programming Constructs

## Data Structures

[Advanced Methods, MIT online](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-057-introduction-to-matlab-january-iap-2019/lecture-notes/MIT6_057IAP19_lec4.pdf)


* `2D matrices`
    * also n-dimensions (e.g. images)
    * every element must be of the same type (int, doubles, characters etc)
    * matrices with many zeros => sparse matrices

* `Cell array`   
    * like an array, but elements are allowed to have different type (suitable when you have mixed data)

* `Structs` (structure arrays)
    * grouping variable names and values into one structure (OOP in Matlab)
        *  data type that groups related data using data containers called **fields**. Fields can be matrix, cell, and even other structs
        * `help struct`
    * they behave like dictionaries in Python

            % create a struct
            myStruct = struct('Name', {'Mary', 'Leo', 'John'}, ...
                "Age", {27,35, 40})
                
            % view the 1st row
            myStruct(1)

            % view specific column value of that row
            myStruct(1).Age 

            % view column values of "Name"
            myStruct.Name    

## If - Loops

In MATLAB:

* if .. else .. elseif .. end (*In Python it would be if-elif-else with ":"*)

        if condition1
            commands1
        elseif condition2
            commands2
        else
            commands3
        end

* loops:

        for n= 1:100
            commands
        end

        % while loop
        %% use break to exit a loop
        while condition
            commands
        end

* Instead of: for i=1 .. i<=3 -->in Matlab--> for i= 1:3

* e.g. iterating through a 2D array "arr" of shape (x, 5), grabbing all column values separately and assign them to a variable called "column values"(which would be assigned 5 times since we have 5 columns): 

        for index = (1:5)
            column_values = arr(:, index)
        end

*from the Matlab academy mathworks exercise:*

        for v= (1:7)
            s = spectra(:, v);
            if speed(v) <= 0 
                loglog(lambda,s,"--")
            else  
                loglog(lambda,s, "LineWidth", 3)
            end
            hold on
        end
        hold off
        % starnames is an array of star names in spectra
        %% otherwise it would be smth like legend("legend title")
        legend(starnames)

## find

* It returns indices of nonzero values, e.g.:

        x = rand (1, 150);
        indices = find(x>0.2 & x<0.6);
