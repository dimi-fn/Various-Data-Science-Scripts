# MATLAB

* Use the Up arrow to see previous commands, 
    * `clear` to empty workspace / `clc` to empty the Command Window
    * `load <filename.mat>` to load again the variables of the file
        * load only 1 variable from a .mat file containing multiple variables: `load someFile x`

* MATLAB variables are case sensitive. They should start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores

* Save files: `save filename.mat`

* If you add a semicolon to the end of a command, the result will not be displayed, however, the result of that command will be displayed in the Workspace window as usual.

* MATLAB does not rerun previous commands in the Command Window (you need to repeat the command for any variable changes)
