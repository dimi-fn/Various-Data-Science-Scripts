In computer programming, standard streams are preconnected input and output communication channels between a computer program and its environment when it begins execution. The three input/output (I/O) connections are called **standard input (stdin)**, **standard output (stdout)** and **standard error (stderr)**.

On CodinGame, the data needed to solve puzzles is given to you in the stdin. Your code needs to print the requested answer in the stdout.

The default code, given in all CodinGame puzzles, already parses the stdin and prints a default output in the stdout.

You can use the stderr for debug purposes. Debug messages will show in the console output (at the bottom left).
