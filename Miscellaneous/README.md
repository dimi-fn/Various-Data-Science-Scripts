## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Two important topics that determine **pagerank** are: `relevance` and `authenticity`, i.e. if the results that websites give are relevant and authenticative.

**Relevance**: 
It is determined by various factors such as:
* content and code implementation
* thematic and semantic (metadata) connections between query and your website



**Authenticity**
* links pointing to you from other websites
* reviews - sentiment
