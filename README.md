# Various-Data-Science-Scripts

Practising with a few example cases, with regard to:
- Classes and Objects in Python.
- Solving problems via Unit Testing (the majority of the problem tasks are derived from [Codility](https://www.codility.com/)).
- Difference between lists, sets, and tuples in Python data types.
- Some examples with functions, e.g. using arguments (*args and **kwargs), lambda, map functions, etc.

More details can be found on each folder respectively.
