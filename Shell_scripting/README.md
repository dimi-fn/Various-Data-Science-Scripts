# Shell Scripting

`Shell scripting` is a program to run on UNIX shell, and `Bash` is a Unix shell and command language

* The terminal can be used on Linux and Mac, the git bash on Windows

## Commands

`which bash` : to know where is your bash



## Notes

`#!/usr/bin/env/ python3` ==> the **shebang line or hashbang**

* `#!` --> ("hash" + "bang") 

* `usr/bin/env python3` --> the path to the executable that will run the script along with any other optional arguments

    * it is a common pattern for Unix based systems

    * it allows a script to be invoked from the command line

    * it should be in the very first line of the script

    * on Windows this line will be considered a comment and hence will be completely ignored
    * on linux of course it will not be ignored since it is Unix based, same on mac because it is based on the BSD Unix
