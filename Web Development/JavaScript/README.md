# Data Types

In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:
* `number`
* `string`
* `boolean`
* `null`
* `undefined`
    * It's denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null
* `symbol`
    * Symbols are unique identifiers
* `object`
    * Collections of related data

The first 6 (all data types apart from the object) are considered **primitive** data types

-----

# Properties

E.g.

* length
    * `console.log("hello".length);`

-----

# Methods

Methods are actions we can perform. We can call methods by appending an instance with:
* a period (the dot operator)
* the name of the method
* opening and closing parentheses

-----

# Variables

* [var vs let in JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/whats-the-difference-between-using-let-and-var)
* if a variable is declared without a value, then the variable's value will automatically be assigned as `undefined`
* constant variable (the variable's value cannot change): `const`

-----

# Operators

* `typeof`
* `ternary operator`
    * e.g., the following:

            let isNightTime = true; 
            if (isNightTime) {
            console.log('Turn on the lights!');
            } else {
            console.log('Turn off the lights!');
            }

    is the same with the below one, using `ternary` operator instead:

        isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!');   

-----

# Functions

A function declaration consists of:

* The function keyword
* The name of the function, or its `identifier`, followed by parentheses 
* A function body, or the block of statements required to perform a specific task, enclosed in the functionâ€™s curly brackets, `{ }`.

        function printHi(){
            console.log("Hi")
        }
        printHi();

In Python, the above would be:

        def printHi():
            return("Hi")
        printHi()
