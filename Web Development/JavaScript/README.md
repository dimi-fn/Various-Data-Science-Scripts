# Data Types

In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:
* `number`
* `string`
* `boolean`
* `null`
* `undefined`
    * It's denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null
* `symbol`
    * Symbols are unique identifiers
* `object`
    * Collections of related data

The first 6 (all data types apart from the object) are considered **primitive** data types

# Properties

E.g.

* length
    * `console.log("hello".length);`

-----

# Methods

Methods are actions we can perform. We can call methods by appending an instance with:
* a period (the dot operator)
* the name of the method
* opening and closing parentheses

# Variables

* if variable is declared without assigning a value, then the variable's value will be `undefined`
