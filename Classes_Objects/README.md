# Classes - Objects

- Classes in python create objects
    * Objects can have properties and can contain methods (functions that belong to an object)

- All classes have a function called "__init__()"
    * It is executed when the class is being initiated
    * It can be used to assign values to object properties or operations
    * The "self" parameter is a reference to the instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to that class
